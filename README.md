## General Information
- I applied ETL process for 4 Oil & Gas companiesâ€™ stock prices (XOM, CVX, COP, EOG) historical data from Yahoo Finance and analyzed the data.
- I built and deployed Deep Learning model to make prices prediction as a Microservice using Python FastAPI.
- I decided to choose Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM), Chevron Corporation (CVX), ConocoPhillips (COP), and EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) as my 4 stock prices to work on because they are among the largest and most dominant companies in the Oil & Gas industry of the United States. Therefore, I think it would be very fascinating to predict, analyze and obtain some insights about their stock prices.


## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.9
- Python FastAPI - version 0.65.2
- Tensorflow - version 2.5


## Features Insights Generated
- Correlation Matrices showed the relationship among the targeted stocks.
- Price prediction for EOG stock by a Neural Network model using Tensorflow and deployed using Python FastAPI.
